Easily control Intel p-state driver on Linux (3.9 and upwards) 

pstate-frequency is able to adjust the Intel p-state driver values for the minimum  
and maximum scaling frequencies and the state of turbo boost. 

# Note


The project has been rewritten in C++. The branch of the project based on the C  
programming language is no longer supported. Please check out the master branch  
and build that version of pstate-frequency, as it is up to date and currently  
the only supported one.
